# blockchain
This is a simple Blockchain project written in Go that shows how easy it is to simulate what happens in a real world Blockchain (of course it has its limitations)

It uses TCP to broadcast updates to all connected users and runs entirely in the terminal

Being a toy project, it is likely to change without any notice!
