# blockchain
This is a simple Blockchain project written in Go that shows how easy it is to simulate what happens in a real world Blockchain (of course it has its limitations)

It uses TCP to broadcast updates to all connected users and runs entirely in the terminal

The (fictional) entity being stored in the Blockchain is _NIN_, short for _National Identification Number_.

It is also worth mentioning that this being a toy project, it is likely to change without any notice!
